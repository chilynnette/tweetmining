In using Jupyter, download the Anaconda at https://www.continuum.io/downloads.
Download the Python 3.6 version (I used this one, some syntax are different from the Python 2.7 version).
The Jupyter Notebook App can be launched by clicking on the Jupyter Notebook icon installed by Anaconda in the start menu (Windows) or by typing in a terminal (cmd on Windows).
Type 'jupyter notebook' in the terminal.
Jupyter Notebook App will open in a new browser window (or tab) by the url http://localhost:8888, click the new button and choose Python 3.
Enjoy!
